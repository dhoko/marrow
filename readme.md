Marrow
======

Marrow is a kinda framework for Backbone.js.

What it doesn't do:

- Magic code
- Coffee
- Twiddling its thumbs

What it does:

- Give you a structure
- Grunt
- Sass
- Handlebars
- Lodash
- ... all you need to begin a great app

## Installation

Depending on ```node.js```, ```npm```, and ```Sass```.

``` $ npm install ```

``` $ bower install ```

## Development

``` $ grunt ```

## Distribution

``` $ grunt dist ```

## Note

I use jQuery as dependancy but if you only focus on Mobile app, you probably should use [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/).
